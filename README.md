JOSEPH MARI S. CORDERO
BSCS 3-B

This is my website which serves as my portfolio. It somehow showcases my skills and qualities as a coder as it 
is highlighted and shared with you, as the reader, my skills firsthand.

It contains a small description of myself, of how I do and code things as a computer science student (aspiring
to be a developer). Next, would be my skills and expertise all throughout the years of my coding here in
West Visayas State University. After that, we proceed to the projects I have made, showcasing each one of my
most proud apps/projects as a coder. Lastly, a little story of mine or an "About me" feature of my page. It serves
as my own roadmap/guide which keeps me humble of what I have done and learned throughout my CS years. And, that
is all for this portfolio. See you, future me :) (hopefully developer ka na kung mabasa mo ni again.)
